Hello, we require the development of an Android App that can use the camera to do:

1. Real-time Object Detection and OCR (Recognizing Text/Numbers) [LOW ACCURACY]

2. Can Record Video and then process it for Object/OCR Detection [MEDIUM ACCURACY]

3. Can Record Video and Upload to Server for Obj/OCR Detection for multiple users [HIGH ACCURACY]

We can provide many sample videos of what the user will be viewing/recording and what objects/text to detect and what to teach/learn.

Please provide the APIs for the AI and UI you will be using/researching.

Thank you for reviewing our job post.


users supply their own videos and use angles suggested by the app, hopefully the AI can help them line it up good as they can


the example we sent is incomplete, thats why we are hiring new

how applicants for this job respond to the information we provide is how we decide who to hire.



people video slot machines inside a casino and our AI app recognizes the reels/symbols/amounts
